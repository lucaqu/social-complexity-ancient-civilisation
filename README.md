README file with instructions to successfully run the code 

(1) At the beginning, download and import the data used in this project. 

#download the social complexity data set which can be obtained from the SESHAT database, and it is also available on "Kaggle")
data set from SESHAT data base: http://seshatdatabank.info/datasets/social-complexity-dataset/
data set Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usharengaraju/social-complexity-dataset-ancient-civilization 

#read the data set into the Jupyter Notebook
social = pd.read_csv(SocialComplexity3.csv")

(2) Then import libraries needed for data exploration. 

#import pandas, a data analysis and manipulation tool
import pandas as pd

#import matplotlib, a library for data visualisation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#import seaborn, a library for data visualisation based on matplotlib
import seaborn as sns

(3) Follow the code chronologically to create figures for data visualisation.
